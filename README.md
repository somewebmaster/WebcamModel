First, let me explain what camscore is and how it affects the camera model that runs on MyFreeCams. Camscore is a rating given by MFC for each website model. The new model starts with 1000 cam scores and goes up or down from this level depending on how much the girl's brand piles up during the camera session (in fact, web cameras can also go up because of "offline"). Tips, but I'll discuss later. The higher the female camera, the higher the room on the MFC list. 

In general, MFC camera models with higher cameras make more money per session than girls with lower cameras.

Camscore is different from the Miss MFC model chart, which shows who makes the most money with MFC each month. The Miss MFC # 1 model does more than the other models. So this is only a contest based on how many tokens have been made each month. 

A camgirl might have camphor around 20,000, which is very high, but she could rank 587 for that month if she wasn't a camel lately. The peephole shows how well the model receives tokens from viewers when active and not how much it does in its entirety.

In the MyFreeCams community for girls, the camscore is hated everywhere (well, that might be a bit overkill) because most models consider it unfair for newer and less established girls who lack many generous fans who consistently give enough advice to keep their yields high.

If you are a new camel at MFC, you probably won't have many fans, obviously because no one knows who you are. If you cannot follow the folded camera model properly, your camera may slip or stop, and you will never get to the first row of rooms on the veranda. Big trucks will probably never find you and you will be stuck in mediocre ranks at the end of your MFC career (or at least until you build fans when you're not there to help you record videos). 

For this reason, and I must agree, Chaturbate is generally seen as a far better choice for an internet model that is just starting (see details on https://balkan-webcam-model.com/).

Now SOME cam girls like MFC Camscore because they reward models who are careful and prudent in doing business on the website. For example, you can take advantage of the fact that "offline tips" (these are only the tips that appear when you don't broadcast) enlarge the camera even more than the tips you get while alive. You can also ask your loyal customers to make sure they recommend you offline so you can maximize your camcorder.

You can also offer Snapchat premium to your viewers and lots of video content for tokens, which will increase costs and the camera. So there is a way for the camera to work for you if you are smart (and I will write more about specific options in the next post, don't worry!).

I also have to mention that there are some hump models in MFC that work very well, even if they don't accidentally follow big fans, just because of their appearance and / or personality. I have seen this many times before (although this is NOT common, don't misunderstand). A truly beautiful and perfect 10-year-old Camgirl came and was inundated by attendees in a matter of minutes. 

This will lure hundreds of people into space, including several large whales that will direct it into orbit close to Earth. The police will shoot and he will do very well at MFC. It doesn't happen all the time, but it can happen and it happens.

So, yes, for most camera girls who want to try MyFreeCams, a camera might be an issue that needs to be addressed. One of the best ways to deal with it, as I said above, is to bring your army of fans when you start stretching there, but there are other ways to do it on time! Attention!

I love this time of year when no one is involved because October is Halloween, which means women can make a living on camera if we know what we are doing. People like to watch cameras during the ghost season because camera models often do a lot of shows and the kilometers traveled tend to impress garbage trucks, which means more characters get in our way.

However, many girls are afraid of the idea of ​​presenting Halloween-themed shows because they don't think they are creative enough to make it interesting. Nobody wants to look like a fool by sitting there with a white eyelash on it. Let me share some of the things I have done in the past to entertain my camping crowd, and maybe you can be inspired to try something like that.

One of my favorite things to do on Halloween is a scary story contest for my regular customers. I will solve horror topics (vampires, zombies, monster attacks, etc.) and tell my fans to write a short story about the topic and send it for evaluation. After all the stories are there, I read them during the show (usually on Halloween night or just before the 31st) and choose the winners based on my own opinion about them and the reaction of the room.

Winners receive lots of free content such as videos and pictures, and I always get a smaller price for runners. Very fun, friend. You will be amazed at how many talented writers you can find in your admirer audience, and reading very good horror stories can be very fun for Halloween. I usually turn off the lights, wear a simple witch costume, and read stories with a Transylvania accent.

If you no longer have much content produced, you can offer alternatives such as a free 20-minute Skype event or free access to Snapchat premium as a top prize. There are many different things you can give. 

The idea of ​​holding a competition is the key to success. The competition involves and engages your audience so they can actively participate in the activities that you do in your space. The audience likes racing and usually makes it more likely to support you as a camera model by making more money.

Another thing you can do, especially if you have a limited budget and can't afford to buy a lot of costumes or decorations, is to play practical jokes in your room. Usually, you just send as usual and then mention that you heard something from another room or someone mentioned your name weakly but alone at home. The idea is to convince your viewers that you are truly afraid of something happening in your home. 

The sound is great for that, but you can also use your cellphone for that. Have a friend call you when you are on camera at a certain time (or send him a short text outside the camera after you are done) and pretend it's a ghostly call. You must answer with "Helloooo". Who is this How do I get my number? "

You can tell your room that the caller is completely silent, but you can hear a little breathing. Acting like you're really scared of that call. Your friend must call again after 10 minutes. You can imagine what you can do with it and it can be very fun. I did it once and it created a very scary vibe in my room that attracted many spectators. It was fun when I learned at the end of the session that everything was a practical joke. People say, "Ohhhh, you bitch!" Hahahaa!

So yes, it certainly doesn't take much until a girl shows a great Halloween show in front of the camera. Just try to be creative and use simple ideas to maintain your room. Don't think about it again, stick to basic things like ghost stories and practical jokes - it's always more than enough to frighten people.

The most important thing is to have fun because Halloween is coming, but once a year! But he can pay for it, right?
